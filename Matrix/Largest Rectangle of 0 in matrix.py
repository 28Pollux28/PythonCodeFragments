In order to calculate the largest rectangle position and area in the matrix, we will first transform the matrix into an
array of histogram (where each number tells how many consecutive zeros (the zero of the row is included) are above the
 number we are looking at). For example, the matrix :
[[0,1,0,1],
[1,1,0,0],
[0,0,1,0],
[1,1,1,0]]
becomes :
[[1,0,1,0],
[0,0,2,1]
[1,1,0,2],
[0,0,0,3]]
Then for each histogram, we will calculate what I called L and R :
L represent the minimum index i such as 0<=i<=x and histogram[j]>=histogram[x] for j such as i<=j<=x
The same process goes for R
The idea is to calculate for each index x the width of the rectangle of height histogram[x]. This is given by :
width = D[x]-G[x]+1
Then width*histogram[x] gives the area of the rectangle.
By iterating on the whole matrix, we can find the largest rectangle.
As for complexity, the create_histogram_tab is a O(n^2), and the largest_rectangle_histogram is a O(n),
giving us an optimal complexity of O(n^2)
